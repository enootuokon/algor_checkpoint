# algor_checkpoint
Repository for the algorithm for counting letters, words, and vowels in a sentence.

Objective 
	- Algorithm to read a sentence, which ends with a point character by character.
		○ The length of the sentence, and number of characters.
		○ The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
		○ The number of vowels in the sentence.
		
		
What is the problem:

	- To read the sentence and determine its length (number of characters)
	- Number of words which are separated by space
	- The number of vowels in the sentence 

The Constraints

	1. how to determine the length of the sentence by noting the spaces between the words 
	2. How to determine the number of words in the sentences separated by spaces 
	3. Only vowels to be counted in the sentence 

The Inputs 
	- The sentence read into the program
The Output 
	1. Number of characters in the sentence 
	2. Number of words in the sentence 
	3. Number of vowels in the sentence 

The Solution

The algorithm should provide the solution for reading; the number of actual characters, words, and vowels in the sentence.
